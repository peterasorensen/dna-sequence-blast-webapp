# Getting Started
Assuming you already have Docker installed, to get started, simply run `docker-compose up`. 
You may also need docker-compose installed.

Install Docker here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
```
# Get docker-compose
sudo apt install docker-compose

# Start the application
docker-compose up
```

Deployment was tested on an Ubuntu machine.
